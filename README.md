# CarbPy
Simple prototype Python function to calculate journey Co2 output per journey in Metric Tonnes
CarbPy A process to Estimate the Carbon Dioxide Emmission in Metric Tons for a given journey.  
From/to Locations are identified and resolved to coordinates, then distance in kilometers calculated using geopy utilities.
GHG emissions (gCO2e/km) per transport mode are derived from 'our world in data' table extract.
To note that this version serves as a prototype or proof-of-concept. It is not meant as a finished product. 
Run environment dependencies include pre-installation of geopy and PySimpleGUI. See Pypi for details about these.
